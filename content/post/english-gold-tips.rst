This is the beginning of a series of posts about English learning. I want to highlight some points on the English learning process that can make a huge difference, especially if these things were noticed at the beginning of the process. Besides these tips, I want to give you a list of material, sources where and how you can study. So, let's do it!

Very well. Many of us are used to studying, learning, having access to a book, and then starting with theory, start to apply, and then keep learning. More or less in that same order. And it's right, there's nothing wrong with it. But if that learning it's about English conversation, or fluency, to be precise, this approach just doesn't work.

If you want to know more English, there you go. You can keep your studies like you're probably doing. Get some books accordingly to your level and study them. However, I'm talking about learning English, not speaking. This standard method doesn't help at all. And the worse is that this same method is still presented on many many English schools around there.

But then, how to get fluency? The answer is simple, just learn how to speak, focus on pronounce. Practice some words and discover how and when to use them. To learn in the same way as babes do, naturally. Listening, repeating, understanding their meaning and etc.

This approach is not new, and it is known as learning backward because you focus on understanding and speaking first than writing and grammar. Maybe that can be new for you, and even shocking, that probably we made the wrong way for so long. The bright side is that now you know how to finally be fluent. For a better understanding, I recommend you to read this post on the best English school ever (in my opinion). `See it here`_ (in Portuguese) or listen to this episode http://radio.inglesnuecru.com/episodes/uma-nova-forma-de-aprender-ingles.

And now, the source tips, where you can find good content and material to really study. Not theory.

Pronounce
---------

Start exactly where you are. Think of the most difficult word for you right now. Let's say that it's the word **world**, focus on it, repeat 10, 20, 50, 100 times. Until you can say it nicely, the closest possible from a native speaker. About that, I like the website linguee_, which offers an excellent pronunciation, as forvo_ website as well, that has pronounces recorded by natives.

- Repetition (shadowing): listening natives speakers and repeat out loud after them without thinking to much.

Listening
---------

If you can understand almost everything from an English conversation, you can start with something more real, like the news, or even classes on the internet (natives teacher please). Another great practice is to listen to podcasts (I love this, I'm podcast addicted).

Important: pay attention to pronounce. Try to understand yes, but the key is to be able to speak like them.

Conversation
------------

And last but not least, the practice itself, challenge yourself and make mistakes. Don't skip this part. Try, even if you are not so confident, or have a short vocabulary. Try it.

If you don't have a group or something like that, I strongly recommend trying TNT_. You must subscribe for a free account and then you can book meetings. The meetings are on the Zoom platform and each meeting has a duration of one hour. They have meetings every weekday, you can choose an hour that works best for you and book. The meeting link will be emailed to you.
