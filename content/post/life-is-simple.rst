Well. I know that this title is a cliche, but it also gives the exact idea that I want to write about. Some time ago (October 2020) I experienced the loss of a family person, a dear person. And in the process, I observed some things and concluded with others, which I want to share now. Stay with me...

Given this tragic reality that we live in, it's more and more **common** to be affected by some terminal illnesses. It's not easy, no one says for sure and nothing is certain. I'm talking about Cancer. Without speaking on always late diagnosis, not allowing them to have time enough for efficient treatment, leaving us only with hope for a miracle from God. Real despair.

It was something more or less like this that I lived in the last week of this unforgettable October. My father-in-law started to get weak, and despite your 73 years old, he always was strong. Shots, tryings, nobody could explain this weakness, that was increasing fast. We went to the public health care, lazy as hell, little could they do.

On a specific day, his weakness came to a concerning point. He couldn't even talk, barely cough. Walk, event seat at the bed, it was impossible. So we decided to take him to the emergency and reclaim him for care. We was needing it quickly. They hospitalized him. Their guessing was for a stroke.

On this same day, at night precisely, I stayed there, at the emergency, until the next day. It was when I saw closely the public health care. I was shocked, scared. On one side people giving their best to see their patients get better, and on another, the resources needed, abandoned by the system. Anyway, I'll let this night for another post.

After one day, it came the diagnosis. Yes, probably what you're thinking right now. (Not covid) It was cancer. The doctors say that there were so many tumors that to make biopsies of all of them will put his life in danger. It was required to make a decision, do or don't do the biopsy. We decided not to do it. Some days after in the hospital, he was **released**. They've sent my father-in-law to his house, and **stay with his family**. Some of us already knew what it meant. Others not, believe me. The doctors said that the better for the moment was **palliative care**.

This situation and this expression (palliative care) were new for me. I know that the name explains itself, however, I don't know that kind of treatment. Now that I've put the context, let me say this. But before, if you don't know about palliative care, check out this page by WOH `palliative care`_ (in Spanish).

Where were we? Ah, as I was saying, this term was new for me, but as fast as discovered its meaning I wondered, what happened to us? What happened to the human species that we let to get at this point? And obviously, I couldn't answer it. The question that made me think was why we need a *protocol* for that, and why this is not something natural. Then I asked myself why even families don't have this kind of treatment on their daily-basis, which is to see our close ones like humans.

And I kept myself thinking about that. To relieve the pain, distressing symptoms, improve the life's quality, mix psychological aspects and spirituals are some of the items listed on palliative care. So I concluded that almost all of those items can be made by anyone. Once we're dedicated to it.

If you allow me a tricky example, follow me on this. What are the recommendations for having a pet? We need to feed and take care of it, dedicate some time, to play, to teach, [strong emphasis here] at the same time. Did you get it?

I mean with all this, to live can be simple if we give importance to what is important, people and moments. That's it for today!

Thanks! Till next time!
