Hello! Welcome to another post in the category #OFFTOPIC! A category mostly about personal thoughts or situations! Today I'm going to write about **podcasts**. My favorite platform and of course, what I've been listening to so far. Let's get it done!

Platform
--------

My favorite platform is PocketCasts_. Before PodcketCasts I used to listen to the shows on Spotify. Because like many people who spend a bunch of time in front of the computer, Spotify already was a friend on my daily basis.

I know that comparing PocketCasts to Spotify is not fair, in terms of features for podcasts, because Spotify is focused on music, a great experience on discovering artists and songs, and now singing (if the lyrics are available.) At least in the times that I'm writing this down. Please, leave me a comment if that has changed ;)

Shows
-----

I have a list basically formed on these topics: **English learning**, **programming**, **spirituality**, **personal growth**, and **others**. I know that there are almost infinite options in each topic, and there are infinite topics too, but my bottom line is the duration of the episodes. The maximum that works for me is one hour. Shows between 20 and 40 minutes are the best. But let me talk about the shows!

English learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Ingles Nu e Cru Radio`_: (English) Made specifically for Brazilians learning English. It's a short show, an average time of 15 minutes. The hosts are a lovely and friendly couple (Alexia, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Foster, from South Carolina, USA). There are a lot of pronunciation tips, how to study, and it's a very funny show. Personally I feel very close to them because I'm listening to this show everyday for more than one year :D

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `Pod Programar`_: (Portuguese) A super funny show, very pleasant to follow. Two girls always happy and ready to share their opinion and talk to lots of guests.
- `Syntax FM`_: (English) Another funny show, mostly about front end skills and development.

|

Spirituality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- MEUCast_: (Portuguese) A show that offers daily texts for meditation in the God's word. It's from a Lutheran community, which I'm part of. I recommend.
- `Timothy Keller Sermons`_: (English) From Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City. No comments needed!

|

Personal growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `Marriage Therapy Radio`_: (English) It's a show that can teach us about marriage and its issues. The hosts are two couple therapists. They talk about all the problems that stop us from having a nice life together and give a lot of tips.

|

Others
~~~~~~
- `Flash Forward`_: (English) About possible (and not so possible) scenarios about the future. Each episode is a brend new surprise. Just go for it!
- `This American Life`_: (English) A weekly public radio show. It is hosted by Ira Glass. Each episode is a very good story.
- `Gadget Lab`_: (English) Inside the hottest personal tech stories of the week; mobile apps, gear, social networking, and entertainment. This one is new for me, so I don't have an opinion about it yet.
- `Your Undivided Attention`_: (English) Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin will expose the hidden designs that have the power to hijack our attention. (Pretty much like the Social Dilemma show on Netflix)

That's it for today guys! I would love to know from you. Please drop a comment.
