Today I want to talk a little bit of what I've been through, what I've seen, about a topic that is (and always had been) hot: keep ourselves updated with market technologies.

Currently (2019, July) I work on a company that has more than 3 decades, one that found its path and its market share. Some of his clients are more than ten years old.

In this context, keeping yourself updated as a professional, means to keep the company updated, and consequently, the clients. However, what did I realize is quite the opposite of what I always thought.

In this whole time, very few have changed, and believe if you want, but the clients feel safe with this stability, or stagnation may someone say.

So my point here is: are you sure that your clients really want to be updated at the most? Or they had rather been safe, stable?

I know this question can be tendentious, and also have his exceptions by area and such, in general, I started to believe that it worth more to master a certain technology and STAY in it until it became a bad thing. And because of that, as a professional, finishing letting some things new tech goes away.

What do you think? Do you have something to add? Leave a comment!
