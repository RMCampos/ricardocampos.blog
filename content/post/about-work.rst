Hey! I've made my mind about starting to write some thoughts about situations, professional life challenges, and, especially my professional life.

I'm addicted to computing, operational systems, and mainly Linux. However, I've chosen to dedicate myself to my career and for now, leave those hobbies behind.

I work in a company called `Kugel`__, and the **model**, ou the **way** here it's not the traditional way, at least for me. As most software houses, people are talking about new ideas daily, suggestions, issues, or improvements that could be done in the system, however, who decide what's a priority and what's not is the *team leader* when the customer allows it.

Although this situation, when everyone is on the same level (something like a fellowship), there's no *team leader*, nor boss (at least here). So there are no rules, like a traditional company. And because of that, it's required to persuade others, to negotiate.

At this point, I have two big questions: the first one, you need to be the best at what you do, you must be the perfect (about impact, changes, effects) and the second one, you will be responsible for it, or like I often hear, you'll be the **child's father**. Think about it.

Well, I said, said, and almost talked nothing. What I really wanted, was to start this topic. I believe I made it. Feel free to comment, and add your idea.

See ya o/
