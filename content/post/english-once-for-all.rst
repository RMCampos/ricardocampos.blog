Hi! Welcome to another post in the #English category! If you're new here, or maybe if you're starting now to make your English learning more serious, `then take a look here first`_, I give some great tips about studying, `and here`_ I wrote what my motivation to take English to the next level is.

So, I have a problem. Maybe you too. We can read in English quite well, we understand most part of the spoken language, including natives one, but... we can't actually have a conversation without having those awkward moments of *uuhhh*, *how I say?* In our head we're translating all the time, making sentences, but instead of talking, we keep thinking too much, surrounded by the fear? Lack of confidence? That's exactly what I want to talk about today. I mean, write. Enough talking! Let's dive directly into it!

We are in 2021, and if you're not able to speak English at least a little, now it's a perfect time to start thinking about it and choose a new path. But how to do it? How to be fluent and confident? Especially if you're like me, and can read and write? The answer to this question is very simple: having as many conversations as possible. Record your voice, read out loud, push yourself. Make mistakes and figure out where's your problem.

Some of the common problems are the **lack of vocabulary, the fear of making mistakes, or overthinking**. I know this based on my own learning process, that's exactly what I'm going through right now. So I decided to write some tips on how to overcome such problems.

P.S.: These are my own opinion!

Lack of vocabulary
------------------

I know this is a big problem. I'm solving it with two major ideas:

- Listening to podcasts, a lot, every day. Native ones, of course.
- Read articles or books. Podcasts or shows with transcript also works very well.
- My recommendations:

Fear of making mistakes
-----------------------

- My greatest fear is to mispronunciation of something. And that makes me think at least twice more times. Instead of having a great experience, I feel bad about the problem, and then I stop having conversations. 
- Making mistakes is good. That's it! There's no way to avoid it. The earlier you got it, the better.

Overthinking
------------

Somehow, reducing or stopping overthinking is related to the two first bullet points. Once you start getting more confident you stop overthinking. I wish I have a better tip for this one, but I don't.

Extra tips
----------

- Stop translating in your head! Try to think in English. Create sentences like a native would do. And forget about translating word by word, it simply doesn't work.
- When in doubt, keep it simple. (by Foster Hodge). We must remember that our English is not as sophisticated as our native language. So simple past works fine most of the time.
- Trust in the process. It takes time.
