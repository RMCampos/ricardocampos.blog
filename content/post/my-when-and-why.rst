This is the very first post in this category. Well, I'll begin by telling you my motivation to take English learning to a serious level and when that happened.

When I was in college, I saw a presentation about English, something like if you can't understand and can't be understood, you're late. Somehow something awakened inside my mind, since then I started to be more and more interested and this has become a personal goal. Later I heard about a course called **My English Online**, by Capes and National Geographic. It was a paid course, however, the government was giving free logins for those who are in public universities. (My case, yay)! So I started there. It was 2013 I think, and I tried to study hard. I really tried, but I couldn't.

The fact is that I couldn't because my real wish was not so strong, and I wasn't taking it seriously. I'm talking about a feeling when you feel really interested and open to something hard. But that willpower came only recently.

Then at the beginning of 2020 everything has changed. In January I received a call offering me a job, and I've got really interested in it. During the interview, at some point, the interviewer asked me if I'm able to speak English fluently. Until that moment I was thinking that the position doesn't require English speaking.

Well, inside my head I was able to speak yes. (But only inside my head LOL). We actually tried to have a conversation, but it was a sadness (for me). Really terrible.

After this talk, I realized my mistake. I knew English, could understand the most parts of a conversation, but my speaking skill was at level ZERO. I've never tried to have a conversation before. What I need it was conversation, practicing. I've learned a lot of English, I've made a lot of exercises and I felt that it was good enough, however, I wasn't able to speak.

This episode was very very frustrating for me, and because of it, on that same day, I decided to be fluent. Then I started to look for speaking, search about conversation skills, pronounce. And I started to practice every day.

Is about my practicing and study that I want to be writing about. While I'm studying and learning, I want to make records of items that can help others. Little tips that can make a huge difference. And well, this was my story, it seems to be pretty much like most of the stories.

For today, that's it. Til next time.
