Hey you! How are you doing? In this post, I want to talk briefly about English courses. Note that I want to share my opinion, and share my experiences. Maybe you do have a completely different opinion, that's fine, and in this case, leave me a comment. But let's dive into the article!

As you may know (don't worry if not), I started my English learning journey in the earlier's 2020, almost two years by now. In this time, I've taken some courses. Not that much, but I could raise an interesting opinion.

But before talking about the courses, I want to bring you a little disclaimer. Something that I noticed after I started these courses. I don't know if that's your case, but I felt terrible for not being able to afford a nice school or teacher. I thought that if I didn't take a great class, I won't be able to learn properly. This way of thinking is not true. If you can afford one, or if you like taking courses, please, go ahead. However, it's quite possible to study and learn by yourself. I should talk more about this in another post. If this is your case, talk to me and I'll help you with that.

OpenEnglish
-----------

My first English course was with these people. Without searching too much I reach out to their website. And I must say, their advertisement is very good. They've got me. Then I've bought a one-year free pass to their platform and live classes.

In the beginning, I was very motivated. Then some months later, I started to feel stuck. The live classes aren't good enough. The platform didn't make me want to study. I'm not blaming them. I don't know really what happened. I all know is that I stopped studying with OpenEnglish before completing one year.

At that point, I still wanted to keep studying, but not there. Then I started searching about how to study by myself. I found out super nice and interesting thoughts. All I have to do was keep myself motivated. Because I'm an old `Inglês Nu e Cru Podcast`_ listener, I finally tried one of their programs. The Fundamentos Challenge.

Fundamentos Challenge
---------------------

This was my first course with them. And I just loved it! The challenges are like short programs, 30 days of focus, created for one specific skill. The Fundamentos Challenge is about fundamentos, like you probably guessed. But you can think like a really good foundation. 

This challenge is about saying hello for the first time, and how to get the conversation going. It covers also misunderstandings and pronunciation. Lots of pronunciation. For me, this was the first really effective course, one that I really enjoyed and learned a lot about.

SoundSchool
-----------

Well, I don't know how to start talking about this course. It's way different from everything that I have seen. Sound School is a 20-week program, 100% driven to Brazilian pronunciation. Every week I learned how to pronounce a new sound. 

The course was developed to cover the main mistakes that we Brazilians do. So if you think your spoken English is good enough, I invite you to listen to some episodes about pronunciation and think twice. I thought I had good pronunciation, but after learning about sounds, my eyes were opened LOL.

Anyways, I think you can up your speaking skill to the next level with this course. 

Reading Masterclass Challenge
-----------------------------

Another 30-days challenge, about reading this time. My second challenge. I have not finished this course yet, but I can tell you some things about it. Here you learn how to read, actually, how to start reading, in case you didn't develop such a habit. How to read in a way that you can improve your English through reading.

In my case, I like to read books, novels. In the past, I've read lots of books, but in Portuguese. Now I'm learning how to read in English, how to deal with new words, when to stop, etc. Right now I'm at the third chapter of a classic one "The picture of Dorian Gray", by Oscar Wild.

Final opinion
-------------

I've reserved a final paragraph only to tell you that you can go really far without a paid course. If you can afford a course, as I said, please, do it. But if not, don't be sad. Remember that if you have motivation, you have everything you need.

In the next few days, I should write more about how to learn by yourself, how to measure your progress, and where to get material. That's it! Have a good one! Bye.
