Hello. I want to share a little of my professional history and career. I don't have great things to tell (yet) but's not because of it that I'm writing. I want to keep a record and maybe serve as a second opinion for someone. Let's go!

I started to work early, in a family company, since I was 14 years old. (I know, that's a cliche, but it's my story). I'm a son of a business man, or should I say visionary!? Because of that, I became a very hard work person, a classic *workaholic*.

At my father's company, I used to be at the counter in the first years, then I started to have an interest in administration. I began learning about selling, finances, bills, and such, from my father's eye, of course.

I learned for real. Then I started to take care of the legal obligations, documents, storage, accounting e that stuff. I truly believed that my destiny would be to take care of my father's legacy, his company. Can you believe that I even started a college in Accounting? Well...

This was back in 2008 or 2009, I don't remember for sure. However, my interest in tech and programming already have shown up and it was present. At the company, I was responsible for the system, support, and updated as well, problems and such things.

In 2010 I made my mind about study programming at a local University UDESC_, a state one, and so very hard to get into. I've studied all my life in public schools, so I made a preparation course. I nailed it. In the second semester of 2010 I've studied day and night and in the summer of 2011 I started college.

At the college I've met my future boss, without knowing yet, at a class called something like SGT - Systems General Theory, he was the teacher. In 2013 that teacher has noticed my efforts and told me about a position at his company. At Kugel_. It was my first job as a software developer. I started with Java, Swing API, screens, all of the desktop, zero webs or related.

However, in 2014, October, after I've completed the first year, there was a misunderstanding and a friend from college told me about a position in another company. I took it. I stayed at Linx_ for seven months and that same teacher called me, talking about coming back and a new opportunity. I've accepted it.

Sometime after I became a partner, shareholder, and since then, I'm there, focused, studying, and learning. Java still our a daily basis, but it has many updates. We have a web system with Java EE and many technologic challenges. About that, I will reserve for another post!
