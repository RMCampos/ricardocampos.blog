What's up, my friend! Today we'll see about the very common subject, **delivering value**. Easy there, don't go away... It's not a hot subject but it's a subject that always brings good results and good discussion. Let's do it?

This is a subject that makes me think for a long time and always throws me out of my comfort zone. Look, I have a tendency on don't deliver value based on greats :strike:`excuses` reasons, and they're always the same. I'm a prisoner of my own :strike:`whim` details that nothing or very little has to do or interfere with the final results.

Let me clarify. As a programmer, I think a lot about the quality of the source code, on docs, if I'm keeping things simple if I'm repeating code if I'm writing in the best way possible. In general, that's good, however, it must not become a problem. I need to remember myself frequently that those **details** little or nothing will bring value to the final product and for the customer.

Understand that I'm not saying that you should write bad code, I'm just telling you some reasons why this could happen sometimes. Don't write bad code. So what I want to do is bring that question: are we delivering value for sure? Or we're just focused on our own meters (from the company sometimes) that just make our lives worse?

[About this subject, I want to give you a recommendation of a podcast called Rapidinha_, by `@edgarberlinck`_ featuring `@henriquebastos`_. It worth it! (In Brazilian Portuguese)]

Back to the subject, frequently I see flame war about tech, languages, libs, and frameworks *hippies* that even though they have good reasons, in most of the cases, they just want to be *hippies*. Sorry to say this, but that is what I have seen out there! We don't see people talking about the best way to attend to the client, about inviting him to decisions and project phases. It seems that the main idea is something like: I don't care about the client, here I'm the boss, my code, my way.

I don't want to go deep, just bring that to light.

To finish I want to let the record that today I'm much more **the client** than **the company**. The goal it's the product, quality, and user experience. And don't **just** a good source code. I tell you again that a good source code it's crucial, but can't decide the result.

That's it! Did you like it? Don't like it? It's all bullshit? Leave a comment...

Till next time! o/
