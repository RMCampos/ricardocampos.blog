English Day One

Hello friend! Welcome to another post about English learning! Today I want to write about the very beginning, where, and how to start. I know it can be very hard, scary, but I also know that it's possible. Stick with me! But first, congratulations if you're reading this text in English. Motivation and a brave spirit really help. But if not, that's ok too, don't take too hard on yourself. 

Without too much rambling, I want to help you get motivated and maybe point you in the right direction, on the right path for a solid start. Beginnings can be tough sometimes, and if you're starting by now, or started for not so long time, you may be struggling to leave the ground. Here are my feelings about it, and some useful thoughts.

Immersion
---------

One of the things that really helped my was get myself immerse at the English language. The most the better. Some classics tips are **change your phone and computer language to English**, **start watching movies and TV shows in English with subtitles in your native language**, however, if you can understand the written language quite well, you can use subtitles in English too.

Now I want to give a pro tip. You, or someone, may say that's to early for that, but I disagree. Try to think in English. Don't translate it in your mind. Think about things around you, in your desk, your house, their names. Try to make sentences in English without think in Portuguese first (or your mother language). Keep doing that until you feel phrases coming easily, until you feel comfortable.

Scripts
-------

I think you may have heard about this idea before. Write scripts to common questions and situations in order to give your mind something to remember easily. But if not, that's fine. Here's the idea, first you think about common and real life situations where you can predict your answer. Some examples are **Hi, you're not from here, aren't you?**, or **Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?**. Scripts works perfectly for interview questions, as you probably guessed.

Once you have some questions, think about the answers. Write them down. You're sitting at your couch or your desk, you do have time to think on great answers, and not struggle in front of strangers. In my case, I've created answers for many questions and moments, here they are.

- Where are you from?
- Can you present yourself, please?
- What do you like to do in your free time? What are your hobbies?
- What do you do for a living?
- Tell me about Brazil?

I think you've got the idea. Now it's your turn!

Culture
-------

Culture is definitely important and sadly not taken that seriously. Culture can motivate you, put you aligned with your wishes, your likes, and lead you to have the required strength to move on, to keep on the tracks. So I'm saying that one of your first steps should be finding something interesting for you about the English culture. It can be music, a song, movies, one place, city, or state.

Must be something that can relate to you. Something you can see yourself in it.

Then you must remember this thing and feed it inside you. (Quite deep LOL?!) For me is the American lifestyle, I like their food too. All the burger options, barbecues, drinks. I also love country music. So when I'm tired, I like to search for places that have country music and great burgers. At the same time that I'm having a good moment, my brain is still connected to English.

That's it for now people! In case you have something to add, please, leave me a comment!
