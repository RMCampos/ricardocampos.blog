Hello. Today I'm going to write about reading habits. At some point, I've got stuck and stopped reading like I used to do before. But I want to change this situation and start reading as much as possible again!

Unfortunately, I can't really say why I stopped in the first place. I think it was because of many reasons, including work, marriage, and study. But now I realize how happy I am when I'm reading. I noticed lots of good feelings about it and also some cognitive improvements too.

My range for books preferences is something else. I really like novels, fantasy, science fiction, mystery, thriller, suspense, young adult, biography, history, crime, religion, spirituality, and self-help. Not exactly in this order LOL, anyways.

Here are some of the books that I really enjoyed:

- 1984, George Orwell.
- Brave New World, George Orwell.
- A Trip to the Center of the Earth, Jules Verne.
- The Odyssey, Homer.
- Great Expectations, Charles Dickens.
- Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (all books), Ransom Riggs.
- Dirty money, Lee Child.
- The 5 Love Languages, Gary Chapman.
- Connecting Your Work to God's Work, Timothy Keller.
- Money is emotional, Tiago Brunet.
- The Song of Troy, Colleen McCullough.
- The D Day, 1944, July 6, Stephen E. Ambrose.
- The Librarian of Auschwitz, Antonio Iturbe.
