I am experienced in customized applications and solutions. Product analysis, development, integration, and deployment. Always keeping myself aware of performance, quality, and solution stability.

My daily basis is a task list (that includes bugs corrections and improvements) organized by importance order. Available 24/7 for customer support on features that I'm responsible for or the ones that I'd been involved in and assist the team about technical issues or routines.

Goal
