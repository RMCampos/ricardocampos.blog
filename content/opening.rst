Hello everyone. With this post I want to open this blog and welcome you. I must say that back in the days I used to keep a blog, with a lot of research and discovering, including important tips, generally about not so known subjects, but that time has ended. (If you want to check it out, see it here `in this link <https://linuxafundo.wordpress.com>`_ in portuguese)

There's some of nostalgy here as well, from my *newbie* times, when I used to be on IRC channels around there, looking for fixes and new friends. Today I still consider myself newbie, but.. anyway LOL

About the content, I want to have a space for my programming projects, professional or not. And eventually to publish one or another Linux tip, once today I'm using the distro Debian, which is very stable.

I expect to have time to write about my goal of use Linux at work. I work in a small company, which the main programming language is Java. At first it should be easy, but the problem is that everyone but me have Windows, and every script and automatization is made for Windows (bat) and not Linux (shell). So I want to write about this accomplishment and maybe give some tips.

That's it. Feel free to comment and say me hi. See ya!
