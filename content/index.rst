Welcome!! My name is Ricardo Campos. I'm 32 years old, software developer, living in Joinville, Santa Catarina (Brazil's South), married and Christian.

Here is where I spend some time with myself. Here you can find about my hobbies, my job and some tech stuff.

I'm working full-time at Daitan_, coding in a variety of languages, in a variety of projects as a Full-Stack developer. If you're interested in learning more about me, please visit the `about page`_! If you want to recruit me, you can start with my resume_.

Nowadays I'm also working hard to improve my English. So I created a group on Telegram (you can join us if you want, here_, we're almost 200 people) for practicing speaking and writing.

Some of my hobbies are writing to this blog, play Mandolin_ (I'm a musician too), and listen to podcasts. However, I really like to read, so I'm starting to read in English to improve my English skills too.

About this blog, here are some of the topics that I write for (less often than I wish):

- `English learning`_
- `Linux`_
- `Work related stuff`_
- Offtopic_

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to get in touch. The best place to reach me is on Twitter_.
