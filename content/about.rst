About me
========

Hello, my name is Ricardo, nice to meet you. This is my personal blog, a space for projects, Linux tips and offtopic thoughts. 

I have a degree in System Analysis and Development from UDESC (a local State University) since 2015, started in 2011, and since 2013 I work as a developer, in love with solutions and motivated by coffee and good code.

I work full-time at `Daitan Labs an Encora company`_ from 9 AM until 6 PM (GMT-3). Daitan is a Brazilian big player in the outsourcing field since 2004.

Speaking about coding, my soul belongs to #Java. I have some knowledge about Java SE (5, 6, and 7), Swing API, Java EE (7, Open JDK 8), Spring Boot, Wildfly (former JBOSS), REST API, and AngularJS at the Front-end. If you're interested in learning more about my skills, please take a look at my resume_.

Feel free to get in touch.

About this blog
===============

blohg_ is a Mercurial_ (or alternatively Git) based blogging engine written in Python, built on the top of the Flask_ micro-framework and some of its extensions. All the content of the blogs are stored inside a repository, and its history is used to build the posts and pages.

Motivation
-----------

Everybody knows that we have a large number of blogging engines lying around the blogosphere, but there are not a many choices for programmers, who are used to working daily with source-code editors and version control systems and may be more productive when blogging using these tools, instead of the fancy WYSIWYG editors and administration interfaces.

Actually this isn't the first project trying to implement a VCS-based blogging engine, but most of the existing projects aren't tied to a VCS and are just using text files that can be versioned with a VCS, without taking full advantage of the VCS's revision history.

This project uses Mercurial as the VCS, reStructuredText_ as the markup language and Jinja2_ as the template engine. All of these are pretty popular within the Python ecosystem and easy to use.
