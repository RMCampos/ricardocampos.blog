Projects
========

Hello! Here you can find the majority of my projects. **Professional**, **Freelances**, **Personal**, and **Learning** ones. Each project has a little briefing about why I had worked on it and a technical section where you can see more detailed aspects, like language, frameworks. And last but not least, there's a section describing how challenging the project was. 

If you have any questions, please, let's talk!
